I"¦<p>Hi, in this post, Iâ€™ll be unpacking and analyzing Vidar infostealer from my <b>BSides Islamabad 2021</b> talk. Initial stage sample comes as .xll file which is Excel Add-in file extension. It allows third party applications to add extra functionality to Excel using Excel-DNA, a tool or library that is used to write .NET Excel add-ins. In this case, xll file embeds malicious downloader dll which further drops packed Vidar infostealer executable on victim machine, investigating whole infection chain is out of scope for this post, however Iâ€™ll be digging deep the dropped executable (Packed Vidar) in Part1 of this blogpost and final infostealer payload in Part2.</p>
